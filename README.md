# Downcast Localization

This repository contains localization information used in [Downcast](https://downcast.fm) as of v3, which is currently in development. Languages that are either supported or I plan to support are listed at the bottom of this README.

## Contributing 

**NOTE** - Downcast v3 is still under heavy development, which means the base (English) `Localizable.strings` file is being changed daily. Until that calms down, this repo just serves as a place to request support for various languages. As soon as possible, I'll commit the base `Localizable.strings` file and we can get to work on adding support for additional languages. At that time I'll announce it on Twitter, Facebook, etc. You'll also get a notification if you click the 'Watch' button at the top of the page to watch this repository.

## Bug Reports
