# Downcast Localization

This repository contains localization information used in [Downcast](https://downcast.fm) as of v3, which is currently in development. Languages that are either supported or I plan to support are listed at the bottom of this README.

## Contributing

**NOTE** - Downcast v3 is still under heavy development, which means the base (English) `Localizable.strings` file is being changed daily. Until that calms down, this repo just serves as a place to request support for various languages. As soon as possible, I'll commit the base `Localizable.strings` file and we can get to work on adding support for additional languages.

Make sure the change isn't already being worked on by searching existing issues. A label exists for each language to make this easy for you. (i.e. To search for open issues for Japanese, use this issue filter: ```is:issue is:open label:japanese```.

## Languages

Don't see your language in the list below? Search the issues and make sure no one else has requested. If not, create a new issue to request that it be added.
